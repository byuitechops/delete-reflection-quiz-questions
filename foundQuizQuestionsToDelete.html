We are going to Luigi’s Pizza for dinner. After that, we will go over to the Jackson Auditorium. The Fairhope Symphony is playing tonight. They have amazing reviews. Also, one of my roommates’ sisters plays the violin in the symphony. She gave us free tickets! Hope you can make it! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Shelley </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>To </p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:shelleychan@email.com\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"mailto:shelleychan@email.com\">shelleychan@email.com</a> </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Subject </p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Going out tonight </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p>Hi Shelley, </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thanks for inviting me!
